# gnssr_spaceborne_cwf_processing
A processing tool for the spaceborne GNSS-R complex waveform products available at IEEC's GOLD-RTR server. The project provides an example for accessing, searching and analyzing the compelx waveform product derived from the GNSS-R raw IF data collected by different spaceborne missions (e.g. TDS-1, CYGNSS, BuFeng-1, SPIRE).
